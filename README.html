<h2>FAQ</h2>

<h4> How do I install the screensaver? </h4>
<p>Double-click Fluere.saver.  Alternately, you can manually put Fluere.saver in
your Library/Screen Savers folder.</p>

<h4> Why is it called "Fluere?" </h4>
<p>"fluere" is the present active infinitive of the verb "flow" in Latin.  That is, it translates
to "to flow."  It's also called Fluere since it sounds cool.</p>

<h2>Advanced&mdash;editing color schemes</h2>

<p>There is a text file you can edit to change the different color schemes used by Fluere.</p>

<p>
Right click on the Fluere screensaver and choose "show package contents".
Within the package, open Contents/Resources/palettes.txt.  Make a backup of this in case you do something bad.  :)</p>

<p>
The first line contains the number of color schemes.  From there, each scheme has a name (no spaces!) followed by the number of colors, and then the list of colors in RGB hex notation.  You can edit this as you wish, adding/removing colors and color schemes; just make sure that the numbers are correct.  If you mess something up, replace the file with your backup.</p>
